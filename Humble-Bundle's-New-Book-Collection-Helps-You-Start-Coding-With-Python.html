                    <p>The newest Humble Book Bundle is now available and this time around it’s all about learning the Python programming language, which happens to be one of the best places to start learning programming, and one that’s always had a special place in my heart because of its popular on the Raspberry Pi.</p>
                    <p>The full collection includes just about every No Starch Press Python book, including beginner’s style books like Teach Your Kids to Code and Python Crash Course, and more advanced books, like Black Hat Python, Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python, and Gray Hat Python. As with previous bundles, the books are divided into three tiers, a $1, $8, and $15 pack.</p>
                    <p>Python Crash Course is included in the $15 tier, and the bundle is worth it for this book alone. You don’t really have to take my word for it though, it has great reviews on Amazon and is pretty consistently a best seller in the programming category. If you’ve been curious about various hacking tools and you’re sick of being a measly script kiddie, then both Black Hat Python and Grey Hat Python are great introductions to using Python for both ends. Plus, you’ll have a much better understanding of basic security by the time you finish both books. You’ve got two weeks to snag the whole collection from Humble Book Bundle.</p>
